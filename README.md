# 🌙 NoRestOS.exe

NoRestOS.exe is a gamified productivity dashboard built as a lightweight interactive operating system.

It connects:
- ⚡ Energy (drains over time)
- 🧠 Missions (task system)
- 📈 XP & Levels (progression system)

The goal is simple:
Complete missions, gain XP, manage your energy, and keep the system stable.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time energy drain mechanic
- XP gain system with leveling
- Visual feedback on XP gain
- System instability warnings at low energy
- Persistent missions using localStorage
- Clean glassmorphism UI
